# ipam
A cli based [IP Address Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_management)
built with [Go](https://go.dev/) using [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/) and
[Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) with optional [PowerDNS](https://www.powerdns.com/auth.html)
API integration.

## Features
`ipam` is a cli based IPAM. It supports:
- Adding, listing, viewing and deleting subnets
- Adding, viewing and deleting single IP addresses with FQDNs
- automatic addition and deletion of forward and reverse records
- import and export configuration

## How do I use this?
`ipam` is built as a cli app. Once you installed `ipam` and added it to your `$PATH`, you can
- add prefixes with `ipam subnet add 192.168.0.0/24 fancy-subnet-name`
- add IPs to those prefixes with `ipam ip add 192.168.0.1 fqdn.example.com`
- add the next free IP in a prefix with `ipam ip add 192.168.0.0/24 fqdn2.example.com`
- much more (see `ipam (command) --help` for examples)


If PowerDNS integration is enabled in `$HOME/.ipam/ipam.yml`, forward and reverse DNS records
are automatically managed when you add or delete IP addresses with hostnames.
